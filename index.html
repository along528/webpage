                            <hr class="star-primary">
                	    <div class="col-lg-16 text-left">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/Insight-logo.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">

                            <p> The Insight Health Data Science program is an intensive, seven week postdoctoral training 
			    fellowship that bridges the gap between academic research and a career in data science. 
			    In the first week of the program we come up with a project idea which is to be predictive and 
			    functional as a working web application. Once we have developed an idea, we spend the next three 
			    weeks building the project independently from scratch. The remainder of the time is spent showing off our 
			    projects and learning together about all sorts of data science related topics.</p>
			    <p> When I was coming up with an idea for my Insight project I knew I wanted to do something 
			    that addressed an issue confronting society head on. One particular issue that has concerned me
			    a lot recently is the issue of police violence that has gotten so much attention recently, 
			    especially through the sharing of cell phone videos over social media. Furthermore, 
			    so many of these incidents seem to be occuring in the black community
			    making it plain to see that police profiling is still pervasive in the US.</p>
			    <p>
			    I wondered, is it possible to compare 
			    police departments that are most susceptible to racial profiling using publicly available data? 
			    It turns out that we can using traffic stop data, which is publicly available in some states.
			    My home state of North Carolina <a href="https://opendatapolicingnc.com/">recently released an API </a>
			    of nearly every known traffic stop in the state since 2002. That ends up being over 20 million traffic stops!
			    Other states have similar efforts though the quality and availability of the data drops off very quickly.
			    In the end, I was able to also obtain traffic stop 
			    data from <a href="http://ctrp3.ctdata.org/">Connecticut</a> and 
			    <a href="https://idot.illinois.gov/transportation-system/local-transportation-partners/law-enforcement/illinois-traffic-stop-study">Illinois</a> as well, resulting in a decent sample from 
			    around the US totaling over 50 million traffic stops altogether.</p>
			    <p>
			    Each of these 50 million traffic stop 
			    records has demographic information about the driver and the police department
			    that the officer who performed the stop was affiliated with. Each record also 
			    has information about whether or not the driver was searched, and if so, if they found
			    any contraband (weapons, drugs, etc). I used that information to compare the experience
			    of black drivers and white drivers after being stopped by police officers from different departments.
			    The results were striking. 
                            <img src="img/portfolio/search_rate_disparity.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
			    <p>
			    The above chart shows the average search 
			    rate (the rate at which someone is searched given that they were stopped)
			    and average hit rate (the rate at which contraband is found given that someone is searched) for a given 
			    police department after controlling for the race of the driver. So, a red point corresponds
			    to the average rates for black drivers in a single police department. Similarly, each blue point
			    shows the average rates for white drivers. Comparing the distributions of search rates for
			    black drivers to that of white drivers, we can clearly see that police departments tend to 
			    search black drivers more often than white drivers. In fact, the average police department
			    searches black drivers about twice as often as white drivers. But there is also a long high
			    tail, with some police departments searching black drivers even more often than white drivers.
			    For instance, the Chicago Police Department has on average searched black drivers about 6 times
			    as often as white drivers since 2003.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			    Furthermore, the huge disparity between the search rate for black and white drivers does not seem to
			    be justified by a higher rate of finding contraband in searches, or the hit rate. Indeed,
			    the same chart shows that the distribution of the hit rate for black and white drivers
			    is nearly identical. So, according to the traffic stop data in these three states, 
			    black drivers are more likely to be searched than white drivers
			    even though they are not more likely to have contraband. This looks to me like very clear evidence
			    of racial profiling. Thus, by using the disparity between the search rate for black
			    drivers and white drivers I can do what I set out to do: compare departments based on their 
			    susceptibility to racial profiling.
			    </p>

			    <p>
			    It is also fascinating to note that in many places, this difference
			    in the search rate between black and white drivers is fairly persistent.
			    I looked at the ratio of the search rate for black drivers over
			    the search rate for white drivers over 14 years in the three largest 
			    police departments in North Carolina. 
			    </p>

			    <p>
			    There what you see is that each of these departments have had
			    a very different level of racial profiling that has been
			    roughly the same over more than a decade. 
			    Every year since at least 2002
			    the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department on average has 
			    searched
			    black drivers about twice as often as white drivers. Meanwhile,
			    the Guilford County Sheriff's Office has shown almost no disparity at all
			    and the Wake County Sherrif's Office has fallen somewhere in between.
			    This stationary behavior of the departments supports
			    using the average of the search rates over time. It also 
			    tells us that these differences are seemingly hardwired
			    into the police departments and the communities they serve 
			    and have been around for a long time.

                            <p>The ATLAS experiment is an enormous collaboration of over 3000 
			    scientists from around 40 countries <!-- check -->
			    interested in studying the millions of proton-proton collisions
			    produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
			    To do that they built one of the largest and most complex machines in the world.
			    Weighing about as much as the Eifel Tower and standing as tall the Notre Dame 
			    Cathedral in Paris, it's like a giant 100 million pixel camera with a shutter speed capable
			    of taking a picture 40 million times a second
			    and with a resolution on the order of microns. It's an impressive machine! 
			    The picture above is of a mural painted of the detector outside the ATLAS control room;
			    though the real thing may be even more beautiful.  </p>

			    <p>
			    I've spent the last 6 years working on the ATLAS experiement. Most of that time
			    I was looking at the petabytes of proton-proton collision data collected by the experiement.
			    You might recall the famous
			    discovery of the Higgs boson announced on July 4th, 2012 - Higgsdependence day. <!-- link, picture? -->
			    </p>
                            <img src="img/frontpage_higgs.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
			    <p>
			    Well, there's me watching the big announcement! (I seem to have made it into an Italian newspaper.)
			    </p>
                            <img src="img/me_higgs.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
			    <p>
			    That was a once in a lifetime discovery which used the same data.  
			    But that data is very rich and so can be looked at in myriad ways.
			    Some analyses of the data attempt to discover other new particles besides the Higgs; 
			    other analyses use the data simply to better understand the performance and behavior of the massively complicated detector in order to aid 
			    in future analyses;
			    still others seek to test the validity of our current best description of the universe, the so-called 
			    Standard Model.  I have been involved in analyses of all three types. 
			    </p>
			    
                            <h3>Searching for the W-prime</h3>
			    <p>
			    In one <a href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/EXOT-2013-10/">analysis</a>
			    we were looking for signatures of an exotic particle called the W-prime.
			    The W-prime is only 
			    theorized to exist, and if it did then it could be a clue to an entirely unexplored realm beyond the Standard Model. 
			    Which would be even more exciting than the Higgs discovery! 
			    We compared the data to what we would expect if the only the Standard Model were true (the null hypothesis)
			    and if the W-prime signal were added in on top of that (the alternative hypothesis).  You can see a plot of just such a comparison
			    as a function of the most interesting discriminating variable.
			    </p>
                            <img src="img/wprime_muon_mt.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
			    <p>
			    The data is in black, while the standard model prediction is shown in the solid stacked histograms and the proposed signals
			    are drawn on top as individual lines.  As you can see, the data agrees really well with the Standard Model and has no need
			    for the proposed signal.  So we looked and didn't find it.
			    But you should have expected that because if we had you would have heard about it and I would be in the running for the Nobel Prize. 
			    </p>
                            <h3>Studying the Muon Trigger system</h3>
			    <p>
			    In another <a href="http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/TRIG-2012-03/">analysis</a>
			    we studied the performance of an online data filtering system called the trigger system.
			    The data comes in so fast from the LHC that there is no way to record it all, so the trigger system uses a combination of
			    fast electronics and computing clusters to make on the fly decisions about which data is the most interesting. In particular, 
			    we focused on collisions that produce a very special (and my favorite) particle called the muon, which is like the electron's
			    obese cousin. As you can imagine, this system is incredibly important to understand. If it's not designed properly we could
			    throw out all of our interesting data without getting a chance to look at it! Fortunately, we understand the trigger system
			    very well.
			    </p>
			    <!-- picture of trigger system?-->
                            <h3>Measuring WWW production</h3>
			    <p>
			    Last but not least, in my thesis analysis we used the data to observe for the first time
			    a process that was predicted by the Standard Model but until the now haven't had a machine that would allow 
			    us to be senstive to it. This is a peculiar phenomenon known as WWW or tri-W production. The Standard Model
			    predicts a particle called the W boson which was discovered at CERN way back in 1983 <!-- check -->
			    and which won Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer the Nobel Prize. Back then they made the discovery using
			    just a couple of collisions where they observed the production of the W boson on its own. Now, in the modern  
			    era of the LHC single W bosons are produced in copious amounts. But W bosons can also be produced as twins or as triplets
			    or in conjunction with other particles, it's just way less likely. And the details of those phenomena, like the rate 
			    at which they occur, has important consequences for the Standard Model. Others have looked at many of these production
			    mechanisms, but none had ever before attempted to look at the production of three W bosons simultaneously. 
			    A particle physicist would represent this process using a Feynman Diagram like this:
			    </p>
                            <img src="img/www_qgc.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
			    <p>
			    where the protons come in from the left and the three W bosons come out on the right.
			    Being the first to look for this type of process presented unique challenges for understanding and interpreting the data, 
			    which I was involved deeply in every step of the way.
			    At this moment, the results of the analysis aren't public, but they should be in the next month or two at which point I will
			    go into detail about the analysis. Stay tuned...
